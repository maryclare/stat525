Hospital length of stay. 


Description 
The Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) was designed to 
determine whether infection surveillance and control programs in the U.S. have reduced 
the rates of nosocomial (hospital- acquired) infection. 

One may be interested here in knowing if medical school affiliation (yes/no), 
and region of the U.S. are associated with mean length of hospital stay in days. 


Data 

This data in the file senic.dat consists of a random sample of 113 hospitals 
selected from the original 338 hospitals surveyed.

Each line of the data set has an identification number and 
provides information on 11 other variables for a single hospital. 
The data presented here are for the 1975-76 study period. 

The 12 variables are:

ID        : Identification number (1-13)
LOS       : Length of stay (Average length of all patients in Hospital (in days))
Age       : Average age of patients (in years)
IR        : Infection risk (Average estimated probability of Acquiring infection in hospital (in percent))
RCR       : Routine culturing ratio (Ratio of number of cultures performed To number of patients 
             without signs or symptoms of hospital-acquired infection, times 100)
RCX       : Routine chest X- ray ratio ( Ratio of number of X-rays performed to number of 
            patients without signs or symptoms of pneumonia, times 100)
Beds      : Number of beds (Average number of beds in hospital during study period)
Univ      : Medical school affiliation (1=Yes, 2=No)
Region    : Region Geographic region (1=NE, 2=NC, 3=S, 4=W)
Census    : Average daily census (Average number of patients in hospital per day during study period)

Nurses    : Number of nurses (Average number of full-time equivalent registered and 
            licensed practical nurses during study period 
            (number full time plus one half the number part time) )
Facilities : Available facilities and services (Percent of 35 potential facilities and 
             services that are provided by the hospital)
