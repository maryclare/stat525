Home Prices Using Realtor Data 

Description

The data file contains information on 76 single-family homes in Eugene, Oregon during 2005.
At the time the data were collected, the data submitter was preparing to place his house on
the market and it was important to come up with a reasonable asking price. Whereas realtors
use experience and local knowledge to subjectively value a house based on its characteristics
(size, amenities, location, etc.) and the prices of similar houses nearby, regression analysis
provides an alternative that more objectively models local house prices using these same
data.

The data set contains the following columns:
