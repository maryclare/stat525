Please keep in mind that these will be updated periodically as I catch and am otherwise made aware of typos.

* Loading the Data for HW 2: [`load_data.R`](https://maryclare.github.io/stat525/content/code/load_data.R)
* Examples from A.6-A.9 of Appendix A: [`appendix_a_6-9.R`](https://maryclare.github.io/stat525/content/code/appendix_a_6-9.R)
* Examples from A.1-A.5 of Appendix A: [`appendix_a_1-5.R`](https://maryclare.github.io/stat525/content/code/appendix_a_1-5.R)

## Additional Textbook Material

## Resources for `R` and R Markdown:
* We will use `R` extensively. Here are some recommended resources if are either entirely or somewhat new to to `R`:
    - [`swirl`](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) is a very unique resource that teaches you how to use `R` from within `R`. I recommend the ``R Programming'' course, it's surprisingly fun even if you know most or all of the concepts already!
    - The folks at RStudio have made a nice [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf) that summarizes various essential features of `R`.
    - `CRAN` has a very comprehensive [reference card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf).
    - The course page for [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://rebeccaferrell.github.io/CSSS508/), a course on `R` taught at the University of Washington a few years ago.
    - The book [Advanced `R`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham gives a very detailed look at `R`'s data structures, e.g. matrices, arrays, and data frames.
* You will also learn a lot by comparing your homework solutions to the ones I provide, although keep in mind that the way I code up solutions to the homework problems is rarely the only way someone could code them up!
